<h1>RAD150 vs LGD-4: My Full Breakdown After Testing Both</h1>

<p>I’ve tested a lot of SARMs over the years, and <strong>RAD150</strong> and <strong>LGD-4</strong> are two that really stood out for strength and lean muscle. I ran them on separate cycles, tracked my results, and here’s everything you need to know from someone who actually used both — no fluff, just real feedback.</p>

<p><strong>These are the exact SARMs I used, both from Chemyo:</strong></p>

<h2>What Are RAD150 and LGD-4?</h2>

<h3>RAD150 (TLB-150)</h3>
<p>RAD150 is a more advanced, esterified version of RAD-140 (Testolone). It stays in your system longer and hits harder with a smoother release. It’s designed for serious muscle growth and strength without needing high doses.</p>

<h3>LGD-4</h3>
<p>LGD-4 is a newer version of LGD-4033, made to deliver similar size and strength gains but with fewer androgenic effects. It’s clean, fast-acting, and doesn’t bloat you up like older SARMs sometimes do.</p>

<h2>How I Ran My Cycles</h2>

<p><strong>RAD150 Cycle:</strong> 10mg/day for 6 weeks</p>
<p><strong>LGD-4 Cycle:</strong> 10mg/day for 6 weeks</p>

<p>Both cycles were done solo. I tracked diet, strength, bodyweight, mood, sleep, and side effects. Same macros each time: high protein, moderate carbs, low fat. No other compounds were stacked.</p>

<h2>My RAD150 Results</h2>

<p>I felt RAD150 kick in fast — within the first 7-10 days. Energy in the gym was way up. My weights went up almost every week. I put on just under 7 lbs by week 6, and most of it looked like lean size. Shoulders and traps really popped. Strength gains were the biggest surprise — heavy lifts felt easier.</p>

<p>I didn’t feel any water retention, and no acne or aggression. However, I did notice some suppression creeping in around week 5. Libido dipped slightly, and I got more tired during the day. I ran a short PCT after and bounced back in a few weeks.</p>

<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Bulking, strength, recomposition</p>
<p><strong>Dose used:</strong> 10mg/day</p>
<p><strong>Where I got it:</strong> <a href="https://www.chemyo.com/product/rad150-solution/?campaign=github&ref=166" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">RAD150 from Chemyo</a></p>

<h3>Pros:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Big strength gains fast</li>
  <li>Noticeable muscle fullness</li>
  <li>Longer half-life than RAD-140</li>
  <li>Great endurance boost</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cons:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Mild suppression after week 5</li>
  <li>Can feel a bit stimmy at times</li>
</ul>

<h2>My LGD-4 Results</h2>

<p>LGD-4 felt a bit more steady and clean compared to RAD150. I started seeing visible gains by week 2. I gained around 6 lbs by the end of the cycle, but everything felt “dry” and lean. Pumps were solid, and I didn’t feel bloated or sluggish.</p>

<p>Strength went up, just not as dramatically as RAD150. Recovery was top-tier though — I could train legs and be ready to go again in two days. The suppression was real, but not harsh. I needed PCT, but recovery was easier than RAD150 for me.</p>

<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Lean bulking, strength, body recomposition</p>
<p><strong>Dose used:</strong> 10mg/day</p>
<p><strong>Where I got it:</strong> <a href="https://www.chemyo.com/lgd4/?campaign=github&ref=166" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">LGD-4 from Chemyo</a></p>

<h3>Pros:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Clean, lean gains</li>
  <li>Fast recovery between workouts</li>
  <li>Good strength bump</li>
  <li>Minimal water retention</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cons:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Still mildly suppressive</li>
  <li>Not as intense as RAD150</li>
</ul>
